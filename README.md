# Learning C Programming Language

This repository was created to keep all my progress during my journey of learning the C programming language. As a programming student and intermediate front-end developer, I realized that I would like to appreciate and understand more about the logic behind software. To this end, I decided to start learning more about the C and C++ programming languages, which will give me a better idea and experience as a developer. The main intention is not to master these languages, but to understand the idea behind everything we create every day.

The content That I'm following mainly is the `@Bro Code` channel on Youtube.
